# ðŸ”Ž Transmission Analysis Tool  

This project analyzes transmission files to detect malicious code patterns, identify palindromes, and find common substrings between transmissions. It implements **string matching algorithms** such as **KMP**, **Manacherâ€™s Algorithm**, and **Dynamic Programming** for longest common substrings.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  

### 1. Search for malicious code in transmissions (KMP Algorithm)  
- Detects if malicious code snippets (`mcode1`, `mcode2`, `mcode3`) appear in transmission files.  
- Uses **Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt (KMP)** for efficient pattern searching.  
- Supports **overlapping matches**.  

### 2. Find the longest palindrome in transmissions  
- Identifies the **longest palindromic substring** inside each transmission.  
- Two approaches implemented:  
  - **Brute Force** (checks all substrings, slower).  
  - **Manacherâ€™s Algorithm** (optimized linear-time solution).  

### 3. Longest common substring between transmissions  
- Finds the **longest exact matching substring** shared by two transmissions.  
- Implemented with **dynamic programming** using a 2D DP table.
